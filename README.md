# T20_Score_Predictor
This model is build using Machine Learning algorithms : Linear Regression and Random Forest and some of the python packages such as Streamlit, Pickle, Pandas, NumPy, YAML, tqdm.
### Processes
1. Data cleaning                                                                                                                                                           

2. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

3. Feature Engineering

4. Modelling

5. Website

6. Deployment

This model will predict the total score at the end of innings by taking some factors into consideration.
